    "There are three types of ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-One-way ANOVA: This is used when there is one categorical independent variable (also known as a factor) with three or more levels, and one continuous dependent variable. One-way ANOVA is used to test whether there are any significant differences between the means of the groups defined by the levels of the categorical variable. For example, a one-way ANOVA could be used to test whether there is a significant difference in the mean weight of three different breeds of dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Two-way ANOVA: This is used when there are two independent variables (factors), both categorical, with two or more levels each, and one continuous dependent variable. Two-way ANOVA is used to test whether there are any significant main effects of each independent variable, as well as any significant interaction effect between the two independent variables on the dependent variable. For example, a two-way ANOVA could be used to test whether there is a significant effect of gender and age group on the mean score of a cognitive ability test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Repeated-measures ANOVA: This is used when there is one independent variable (factor) that is measured at multiple time points or conditions, and one continuous dependent variable. Repeated-measures ANOVA is used to test whether there are any significant differences between the means of the repeated measures or conditions, and to control for the effects of individual differences by treating each participant as their own control. For example, a repeated-measures ANOVA could be used to test whether there is a significant effect of a training program on the mean reaction time of participants, where reaction time is measured before and after the training program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to choose the appropriate type of ANOVA based on the research question and the design of the study. One-way ANOVA is used when there is one independent variable, two-way ANOVA is used when there are two independent variables, and repeated-measures ANOVA is used when there are repeated measurements or conditions of one independent variable."

    "The partitioning of variance in ANOVA refers to the process of decomposing the total variance of the dependent variable into its component parts, which are attributed to the different sources of variation in the study. These sources of variation can be divided into two categories: within-group variance (also called error variance) and between-group variance (also called treatment or factor variance). The process of partitioning variance is essential for understanding how much of the total variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ANOVA, the total variance of the dependent variable is partitioned into three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-The within-group variance, which represents the variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the independent variable(s) or factor(s) in the study. This variance is typically assumed to be due to random error or chance factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-The between-group variance, which represents the variation in the dependent variable that is attributed to the independent variable(s) or factor(s) in the study. This variance reflects the differences between the means of the groups defined by the levels of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "3-The residual or error variance, which is the remaining variance after accounting for both the within-group and between-group variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the partitioning of variance is important for several reasons. First, it allows researchers to determine whether there are any significant differences between the means of the groups defined by the levels of the independent variable(s) in the study. Second, it helps researchers to identify the sources of variation that are most important for explaining the variability in the dependent variable. Finally, it enables researchers to estimate the effect size of the independent variable(s) or factor(s) on the dependent variable, which is a crucial piece of information for interpreting the practical significance of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the partitioning of variance is a fundamental concept in ANOVA that allows researchers to determine whether there are significant differences between groups, identify the sources of variation, and estimate the effect size of the independent variable(s) or factor(s) on the dependent variable.\n",

    "# Q11. An educational researcher is interested in whether a new teaching method improves student test scores. They randomly assign 100 students to either the control group (traditional teaching method) or the experimental group (new teaching method) and administer a test at the end of the semester. Conduct a two-sample t-test using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in test scores between the two groups. If the results are significant, follow up with a post-hoc test to determine which group(s) differ significantly from each other."
