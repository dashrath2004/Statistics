    "1.Descriptive Statistics :  Descriptive statistics is used to describe the basic features of the data in a                               study. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. For                                   example, if we want to know the average height of students in a class, we can                                 use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean height of the students.\n",

For example, if                             we want to know the average height of all students in a school, we can use                                   inferential statistics to estimate the mean height of all students based on a                                 sample of students.\n"

    "The level of measurement is important because it determines the type of statistical analysis you can carry out. Knowing the level of measurement helps you decide how to interpret the data from that variable. The different levels limit which descriptive statistics you can use to get an overall summary of your data, and which type of inferential statistics you can perform on your data to support or refute your hypothesis. For example, if you classify your data at the ordinal level of measurement, you know that you can evaluate how items compare to each other based on a specific hierarchy.\n",

If we measure income at the nominal level (e.g., male/female), we can only calculate the frequency of each group. If we measure income at the ordinal level (e.g., low/medium/high), we can calculate the frequency and median income for each group. If we measure income at the interval level (e.g., dollars), we can calculate the frequency, median income, mean income, and standard deviation for each group. If we measure income at the ratio level (e.g., dollars with a true zero point), we can calculate all of these statistics as well as ratios between incomes."

    "1.Descriptive statistics are used to describe a data set or a population using summary statistics, graphs, and tables. They are typically more definitive and are used to understand a group of data much more quickly and easily compared to just staring at rows and rows of raw data values. For example, suppose we have a set of raw data that shows the test scores of 1,000 students at a particular school. We might be interested in the average test score along with the distribution of test scores. Using descriptive statistics, we could find the average score and create a graph that helps us visualize the distribution of scores. This allows us to understand the test scores of the students much more easily compared to just staring at the raw data.\n",

Examples of measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. The mean is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. The median is the middle number in an ordered dataset. The mode is the most frequent value. Measures of variation show the dispersion or spread among data values. Examples of measures of variation are standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum variables, kurtosis, and skewness.\n",
