    "Skewness is a measure of how asymmetric or distorted a distribution is from a symmetrical or normal distribution. Skewness can be quantified and indicates the direction and magnitude of the deviation. Skewness affects the mean, median, and mode of the data and can have implications for statistical inference and modeling. Skewness can be positive or negative, depending on whether the data is skewed to the right or to the left of the median."

    "Covariance and correlation are two statistical concepts used to determine the relationship between two random variables. The main difference is that correlation measures both the strength and the direction of the linear relationship, while covariance only measures the direction. Correlation is also dimensionless, meaning it does not depend on the units of the variables, while covariance does. Correlation values range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, 0 indicates no relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship. Covariance values can be any number, where positive values indicate a positive relationship, negative values indicate a negative relationship, and zero indicates no relationship.\n",

For example, covariance can be used to measure how the stock prices of two companies vary together, while correlation can be used to measure how strongly they are related. Correlation can also be used to test for causal relationships between variables, such as how smoking affects lung cancer risk. However, correlation does not imply causation, meaning that other factors may be involved in the relationship\n",
